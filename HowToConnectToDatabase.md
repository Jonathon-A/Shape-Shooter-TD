# How to connect to the database
Apologies, I only know how to do this in NetBeans. The program can run without connection to the database but with limited functionality
1) Make sure you have Java DB installed (I believe NetBeans IDE 8.2 comes with it installed)
2) Go to the Services tab and click on Databases and then right click on Java DB and click properties

3) Set the correct path for the Java Db installation if it has not already
4) Set the Database Location to the Shape_Shooter_TD_Database folder within the main project folder

5) Right click Shape_Shooter_TD_Database (under Java DB) and click connect
6) ![alt text](https://github.com/Jonathon-A/Shape-Shooter-TD/blob/main/Example%20Images/Connect.png)
7) Enter username and password if required (Username: "Shape_Shooter_TD_DatabaseUsername", Password: "Shape_Shooter_TD_DatabasePassword")
8) You will have to connect to the database before running the program
